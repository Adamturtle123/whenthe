#----Todo list:
#-------Main stuff-------:
#create window and all simple logic(easy) (DONE)
#load the map (DONE)
#load up the player use the entity.py (DONE)
#code the player logic :
#----collusion (done)
#----walking (DONE)
#----double jump (sorta) it's done nigga


#-------Game logic------:
-------Animation-------:
#Create animation system:

#load in animation images in a list:
----first open up the directory where all the images are
----iterate through all the path inside the directory
---- we need to unify the images names like this [walk_0.png, walk_1.png]
---- get the images names by ignoring the .png from the entire string

----use the path to load in all the images
---- add these loaded images to a list inside a dictionary this dictionary will have a key with the name of the state (since we unify name, we use the name of the image for the state)
---- each entity will have an instance from the animation class

---- create a set_action method where we can decide what action shoud play: 
#iterate through these images
#display each image by an index so img_list[i], where i is the key_frame the frame where we are at
#I have a better idea!

I want an animation system that let's you load each animation and know the 'state'or action that animation is peforming
and let's you access each key_frame so if you have a hit animation and you want it to do something when we're hitting and on the 5th frame say.

I have another suggestion of putting all the images in a dictionary and the key of the dictionray is the state that the animation is peforming
and this key points to the list of images that the animation consist of.

I want a way to let us control the speed of each frame, basically how long each frame last 





-----shop logic-------:
#code shop system that let's you buy plants (Half done) -----> if player press e: make him buy something (later)
  ------button detection (done)
  ------ when player press the buy button, the shop will spawn a plant and player can pick it up
  ------ shop will decrease from the player's money 

#ability to plant these shurbs
#make plants grow cycle using timers, when plant reach final form draw the cluster then ability to pick it up
#make simple inventory slots (like in heroes)
#make ability to sell plants to shop and add score



------plant-----
#code plant class (inherits from entity and item for short make it inherit from item)

#abilty to pick up plants
#ability to plant plants    
#ability for the plant to grow over time into 3 different phases 
#at last phase make plants be able to be harvested and when harvest the fruit gets added to your inventory




#ability to pick up the rifle and put inventory (DONE)---
#make ability to gun follow cursor (SORTA) it's done nigga bug: (The rotation is so gunky fix it!!) (FIXED)---
#make ability to shoot with gun (Bug) (when we shoot the bullet can change direction when it's spawned as if we're controlling it) (done)---

#abilty to shoot gun: (done)--
check if we use the left click: (done)--
then add projectile objects inside the bullets list (it's going to be passed by the item_func) (done)---


#handle bullet:( done)
move the bullet x by the cos of the gun angle (make sure you pass the gun angle when you create the projectile object to avoid being able to modify bullet angle later.)
the same with y---
done ---

#Bug : Whenever we shoot the bullets  doesn't shoot at direction of the gun(revisable)
#Bug (I changed the angle to increamenting it manually and not by the get_direction function, and added red line to detect where exactly the mouse looking at) the mouse misses the direction of the gun
#-------enemies-----:
#make mask when got hit (done)
#make melee enemy (slime)
#make ranged enemy (idk a peashooter)
